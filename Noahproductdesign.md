## Noah Product Design Flow
- Noah Swap is an open source decentralized exchange that allows users to trade freely on the chain. It is a DeFi infrastructure open to everyone. As with most AMMs, trades between specific asset pairs are facilitated by holding reserves of both assets. It sets the transaction price between them based on the size of its reserves, and the price changes with the number of tokens in the pool. Any user is free to join or withdraw from the token liquidity pool, and becoming a liquidity provider or LP will bear part of the transaction risk in exchange for returns.
- How do AMMs work? As long as you deposit two tokens of equal value into a pool, you are a liquidity provider. Traders pay fees to the fund pool, and the fees will be allocated to liquidity providers according to the share of the fund pool as a return for their liquidity.
- Example: EOS / USDT liquidity pool: We call the EOS share of the fund pool x, and the USDT share y. Noah multiplies these two quantities to calculate the total liquidity of the pool. Let's call it k . The idea behind Noah is that k must remain constant, which also means that the total liquidity in the pool is constant. Therefore, the formula for the total liquidity of the fund pool is: x*y=k
- So what happens when someone wants to trade? Alice uses the EOS/USDE liquidity pool to buy 1 EOS with 10 USDT. In this way, she increases the USDT share of the fund pool and decreases the EOS share of the fund pool. This means that the price of EOS will rise. After the transaction, the EOS of the pool decreases, and we also know that the total liquidity (k) is constant. This mechanism determines the price of the token. Ultimately, the bid price for that EOS depends on how much the ratio between x and y changes for that transaction.
- Noah is composed of community members and aims to open a new generation of exchanges that are more decentralized and "zero" risk. In the future, we will explore many possibilities on the new DeFi, including but not limited to: upgrade on the basis of the Uniswap V3 algorithm to provide users with leveraged market-making and leveraged incentive functions; cross-chain DeFi between EOS and EOS EVM Combined with DeFi aggregator functionality, and many other innovations we can dream up. We will do our best to make Noah an innovative and leading DeFi on EOS EVM.

## 诺亚产品内容设计流程
- Noah Swap是一个开源的去中心化交易所，允许用户在链上自由交易。它是一个开放给所有人使用的 DeFi 基础设施。与大多数 AMM 一样，特定资产对之间的交易是通过持有两种资产的储备来促进的。它根据其储备的大小来设定它们之间的交易价格，价格会随着池中代币数量的变化而变化。任何用户都可以自由加入或退出代币流动性池，成为流动性提供者或LP者将承担部分交易风险以换取回报。
- AMM如何运作？只要您將兩個價值相等的代幣存入資金池，您就是流動性供應者。交易者向資金池支付費用，費用會按照資金池份額分配給流動性供應者，作為他們提供流動性的回報。举例： EOS / USDT 的流動性資金池：我們把資金池的 EOS份額稱為 x，而 USDT 的份額稱為 y。Noah將這兩個數量相乘，計算出資金池的總流動性。我們稱之為 k 。Noah 的背後理念就是，k 必須保持不變，這也意味著池中的總流動性是恒定的。因此，資金池總流動性的公式為﹕ x*y=k
- 那麼，有人要交易時會發生什麼事呢？Alice 使用 EOS/USDE 流動性資金池，以 10 USDT 購買 1 EOS，這樣，她增加了資金池的 USDT 份額，同時減少了資金池的 EOS 份額。這代表 EOS 價格會上升。交易後，資金池的 EOS 減少，而我們亦知道總流動性（k）是恒定的。這個機制決定了代幣的價格。最終，該 EOS 的買入價就取決於該交易在 x 和 y 之間的比率變化了多少。
- 诺亚由社区成员组成，旨在开启更去中心化、“零”风险的新一代交易所。未来，我们将在新的DeFi上探索很多可能性，包括但不限于：在Uniswap V3算法的基础上进行升级，为用户提供杠杆做市和杠杆激励功能；EOS 和 EOS EVM 之间的跨链 DeFi 结合 DeFi 聚合器功能，以及我们可以梦想的许多其他创新。我们将尽最大努力使Noah成为EOS EVM上创新领先的DeFi。
